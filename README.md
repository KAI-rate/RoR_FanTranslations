## Creating your own translations
Check out the "Pak Template" directory to create a generic translation patch (a language that isn't added to the main menu dropdown via the MASTER pak yet).
It contains a readme that explains how to create a pak file with the provided folder structure and file.

If you tell us about it in the discord's modding thread, it can possibly be added to the Master pak.
