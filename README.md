# Ranch Of Rivershine Fan Translations
This community project aims to add unofficial translation patches to the game to make it more accessible.

It works similarly as texture replacement and similar mods: You download the .pak files and drop them into your game's Paks folder.

This mod is meant to be modular and allow for collaboration. The Master pak file is necessary for all languages that are added with the mod, as it changes the main menu settings to add additional languages to the dropdown selection. To enable the actual language packages, you then add whichever language paks you want to use to your game's Paks folder. If you select a language in the dropdown that you don't have a language pak installed for, it will just show you the default language instead so you don't have to worry about downloading all language paks and deleting them shouldn't cause any issues either.

## How to contribute
1. Download the UE4LocalizationsTool from here to be able to edit and save the locres files without breaking their formatting and encoding: https://github.com/amrshaheen61/UE4LocalizationsTool/releases/tag/v1.8
2. Select the branch of the language you want to contribute to.
3. Fork this repository.
4. Make your changes in the forked repository.
5. After you're ready to share your changes, create a pull request.

## Creating your own translations
Check out the "Pak Template" directory to create a generic translation patch (a language that isn't added to the main menu dropdown via the MASTER pak yet).
It contains a readme that explains how to create a pak file with the provided folder structure and file.

If you tell us about it in the discord's modding thread, it can possibly be added to the Master pak.
